this [link](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/navigation/deep-linking)

Run deep links in **iOS**, use the command below:

```bash
xcrun simctl openurl booted amiiboapp://amiiboexample.com/amiibos/{type}/amiibo/{id}
```

Run deep links in **Android**, use the command below:

```bash
~/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools/adb shell am start -a android.intent.action.VIEW \ -c android.intent.category.BROWSABLE \ -d amiiboapp://amiiboexample.com/amiibos/{type}/amiibo/{id}
```

### Unit testing and coverage

To execute the unit testing and show the coverage, you must run the `test_coverage` file by console.

#### Mac and Linux

Before to run the script, you must have installed the `lcov` package.

For macOS, via `brew` (you must have the home brew already installed).
```bash
brew install lcov
```

For Linux use the command below.
```bash
sudo apt -y install lcov
```

After, you must run the `test_coverage.sh`.

```bash
bash test_coverage.sh
```

#### Windows

Before to run the script, you must have installed the `lcov` package via `chocolatey` (you must have the chocolatey
already installed).

```powershell
choco install lcov
```

After, you must run the `test_coverage.ps1`. If running the `ps1` file you have an error, you must run as administrator
